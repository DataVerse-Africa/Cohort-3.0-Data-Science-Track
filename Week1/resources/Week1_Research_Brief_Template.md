# Research Brief — Baseline ML for Agricultural Yield

**Team:**  
**Date:**  

## 1) Problem & Stakeholder Context
- Business question and why it matters (who uses the predictions?).
- Decision & action if the model is deployed (what changes?).
- Success metric (e.g., ±0.3 t/ha MAE).

## 2) Data
- Source(s) (FAOSTAT, field surveys, weather APIs, etc.).
- Time span, spatial scope, grain of observation (field/season/region).
- Data dictionary (variables, units).

## 3) Methods
- Target variable definition, feature list (raw + engineered).
- Preprocessing pipeline (imputation, scaling, encoding).
- Baseline model(s) and rationale.

## 4) Results
- Holdout scores (MAE, RMSE, R²) + baseline plots (residuals).
- Error analysis: where does the model underperform?

## 5) Risks & Responsible AI
- Potential leakage risks and how you mitigated them.
- Bias/fairness concerns (regions/varieties underserved).
- Data privacy & consent considerations.

## 6) Limitations & Next Steps
- What you would try next (CV, tuning, alternative models).
- Data you wish you had.

## 7) References
- Cite datasets, papers, and tools used.
